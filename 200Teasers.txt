After hearing the first student, the second student removes 
her blindfold, sees the other two students’ hats, and says that she cannot say for certain the color of her own hat. After thinking and without removing his blindfold, the last student says he knows the color of his hat. Which is false? Note: Any combination of a, b, c, d, and e may be the correct answer.

	 1.	 A quarter and a nickel
Be careful of what the wording says: One is not a nickel, but 
the other is. This is a standard trick in the English language. When you say, “one of them is not a nickel,” it doesn’t mean that both are not nickels. The key strategy is to pay attention to the wording and not assume anything. The mind gets lured into a process that seems natural. So if you hear someone say, “one of them is not a nickel,” you may assume that the person means that both are not nickels. But the statement “one is not a nickel” does not imply that the other cannot be a nickel.

Okay, that may be a cheap one! The fact that “one word” in

	 3.	 (a) 30
Average rate is not the average of the rates, and the answer is 
not 40. Also, the distance does not need to be known. Where 
a and b are the two rates, the average rate can be shown to be 
2ab/(a + b), so 2(20)(60)/(20 + 60) = 30.
Detailed explanation: Average rate = Total distance/Total 
time. Let’s say the distance is D one way. Then the total 
distance is 2 D. Let’s say the time the car travels 20 mph is 
t and the time the car travels 60 mph is T. Then from the 
formula Rate  × T
ime = D
istance, 20  × t = D 
and 60  × T = D. 
T
his gives you t = D/20 and T = D/60. So the total time is 
t + T = D/
20 + D/
60. This is equal to t + T = 8
0D/1,200  = D/

So the average rate  = 2D/
(t + T) = 2D/

	 6.	 Thirteen nickels, one dime, and one quarter
The cleverest way to solve this problem is to try to reduce the 
number of possibilities to a minimum and then figure out all of those possibilities. The highest number of quarters I can have is three, since if I have at least one of every coin, I can’t have four quarters (and I can’t have more than four quarters because the total would be more than $1). So, if I have three quarters, I am left with fourteen dimes/nickels, which must add up to 25 cents. That’s impossible, so suppose I have two quarters. That leaves 50 cents for the dimes/nickels. I can’t get fourteen dimes/nickels that add up to 50 cents. So, try one quarter. I have 75 cents left. I can get thirteen nickels and one dime to total 75 cents.
The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
86There is also an algebraic way of solving this problem:
Let’s say I have n nickels, d dimes, and q quarters. The total 
number of coins can be represented as:(Equation 1) n + d + q = 15.The value of all the coins is:(Equation 2) 5 n + 10 d + 25 q = 100, since a nickel is worth 5 
cents, a dime is worth 10 cents, and a quarter is worth 25 cents.Let’s divide the second equation by 5. We get:(Equation 3) n + 2d + 5q = 20Multiply Equation 1 by two:(Equation 4) 2n + 2d + 2q = 30Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4. We get:(Equation 5) n – 3q = 10Now, because of Equation 2, q must be either 1, 2, 3, or 4 and 
not more than 4, since n and d must be both positive numbers.
We know from Equation 1 that n must be less than 15, since 
d
 
+
 
q must be positive numbers.
If q = 4, Equation 5 tells us n = 22, which is impossible.If q = 3, n = 19, which is impossible.If q = 2, n = 16, which is impossible.Therefore, q = 1, which makes n = 13 and d = 1.Therefore, I have thirteen nickels, one dime, and one quarter.

But if the statement “The file will be deleted” is false, according to what is mentioned in the question, the file will be deleted, making the user’s statement true, which would be contradictory. So if the user types “The file will be deleted,” the computer will not be able to perform a function with the file and probably shut down.
	 8.	 Terry is 5 years old.
Translate words to math. “Alice was five years older than Terry 
is now” translates to a = 5 + T, where a is the age that Alice was.
Now translate again. Terry is half as old as Alice was: T = 
(1/2)a. Substitute for a:
T = (1/2)(5 + T).2T = 5 + T,T = 5.So, Terry is 5 years old.

correct.
An imaginary number is a number such that when multiplied 
by itself it becomes a negative number. However, there is no way a real number multiplied by itself will give you a negative number. Thus, the term imaginary . For example, two times 
an imaginary number cannot be thought of as greater or less than three times the number. Therefore they are called “not ordered.” The real numbers are ordered. For example, three times the number 25 is greater than two times the number 25.
	 10.	 355 × 356 is greater than 354 × 357.
There are more than seven ways to answer this question de-
pending on how your mind works. One strategy is to find a way you can divide to make the problem simpler. The simple way is to divide both quantities by 356 × 354. You then get to compare 357/356 with 355/354. 357/356
 = 
1
 1/356 
and 
355/354
 =

 1/354. 
So, the original second quantity is greater 
than the original first quantity.

It is better to get a single discount of 50 percent. Do not get 
lured into a process that sounds superficial. In fact, it is always better to get a single discount of the sums of the successive discounts than to get the successive discounts. For example, suppose the item was originally $100. A single discount of 50 percent would give you the item at $50. Now, if I had suc-cessive discounts of 20 percent and 30 percent, the first 20 percent discount would give me $80. The second 30 percent discount on $80 would give me $56.

Do this problem in steps by starting with two socks. If you 
get only two socks, they could be different colors, but getting three guarantees that you will have a pair. The strategy is to realize that in order to be sure of what you get, you have to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst case is that if you reach in the drawer, you’ll get two different color socks the first two tries—let’s say a blue sock and a brown sock the first two tries. But the third try you’ll have to get either a blue or a brown sock, which will make a pair with one of the first two socks.

The key is to realize that “now” must be Friday. Look for

must be Friday, since two days from Friday is Sunday. Now look at the phrase “the day before yesterday.” Yesterday is 
Thursday since now (today) is Friday. “The day before yester-

Now subtract 4AB from both columns.We get:

The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
120that from the original number you get a number that is a 
perfect multiple of 9. Here’s the proof: Represent the two-digit number as 10 t + u where t is the tens digit and u is the 
units digit. Adding the digits, we get t + u. Subtracting from 
the original number, we get 10 t + u – t – u = 9t. Since t is an 
integer, the only choice that fits is (f) 36. What’s more in-teresting is that any number that is a multiple of 9 has digits that add up to a multiple of 9.
Here’s a great parlor trick: Have someone choose a number. 
Then have that person add the digits. Then have the person subtract that result from the original number to get a final result. Have the person now cross out one of the digits in the final answer. You will be able to tell the person what digit he crossed out if he tells you the remaining digit. For example, he starts with 23. 2 + 3 = 5. 23 – 5 = 18. He crosses off the 8. He is left with 1. You will be able to tell the digit crossed out. Why?
Any number that is a multiple of 9 has digits that add up to 
a multiple of 9. So whatever number you crossed out, the crossed-out number must be 9 minus the number left!

126Detailed explanation: The average rate of a car going uphill 
at a miles per hour and downhill at b miles per hour the same 
distance is just 2ab/(a + b). Proof: Call the distance d. Call the 
time it takes for the car to go uphill t. Call the time it takes 
for the car to go downhill the same distance, d, T. Because

Distance,
(1) a × t = d
(2) b × T = dThe average rate is the total distance divided by the total 
time. That is 2d/(t + T).
Using (1), we get t = d/a and (2), T = d/b.So 2d/(t +T) = 2d/(d/a + d/b), which can be seen to be just 
2ab/(a + b).The average of the rates a and b is just (a + b)/2.So Quantity A is just 2ab/(a + b) andQuantity B is just (a + b)/2.Multiply both quantities by 2. You getQuantity A: 4ab/(a + b)Quantity B: a + bNow multiply both quantities by (a + b).You getQuantity A: 4ab
ansWers
127Quantity B: (a + b) × (a + b) = a2 + b2 + 2 × b × a
Now subtract 4ab from both quantities. You get
Quantity A: 0Quantity B: a
2 – 2 × b × a + b2 = (a – b) × (a – b)
Since a is not equal to b, (a – b) × (a – b) is always greater 
than 0.Thus Quantity A is less than Quantity B and so the original 
Quantity A [2ab/(a + b)] is less than the original Quantity B 
[(a + b)/2]. Thus, the average rate of the car going uphill at 
a miles per hour and downhill at b miles per hour is less than 
the average of the rates a and b.

You need to use the formula Rate × Time = Distance, that 
is r × t = d. For the uphill trip,
r (uphill) × t (uphill) = 1 mile
For the downhill trip,r (downhill) × t (downhill) = 1 mileThe average rate of the car is the total distance traveled 
(2 miles) divided by the total time traveled, t (uphill) + t 
(downhill).
Since the average rate was given as 20 mph, 20 = 2 divided by

The probability would be 2/3, not 1/2! Many people have 
thought that there is a 1/2 chance of having the car behind the door the contestant chose since there are two doors. However, because you have chosen a door first, out of three, there is a 1/3 probability there is a car behind it, and there would be a 2/3 probability any other door has the car behind it. So if you chose two of the other doors, you would have a 2/3 probability of the car. And if one door was eliminated 
ansWers
137by the host, since that door had the goat, if you switched 
doors, then it would be in effect as if you were choosing two doors, which would give you the 2/3 probability that the car was behind the remaining door.
Another explanation:Interestingly enough, the answer is that the contestant should 
switch doors, because there is actually a 2/3 chance of winning the car by switching, while there is only a 1/3 chance of win-ning the car if the contestant opens his or her original door!
This is how most people’s minds approach the problem: The 
host eliminates one door with the goat, so there is a goat or a car behind the contestant’s door. So the probability is 1/2. And it doesn’t matter whether the contestant opens his or her original door or changes doors. But let’s see what is really happening. The probability of having a car behind the contes-tant’s door when he or she originally chooses the door is 1/3, since there are three doors and only one door that has a car behind it. And there is a 2/3 probability that the car is behind one of the other two doors (since there are two ways a car can be behind one of the remaining doors [car-goat; goat-car] out of a total of three possibilities: car-goat; goat-car; goat-goat). Now, if the host eliminates a door, there would still be the 1/3 probability that the car was behind the contestant’s original door—so once a door is eliminated, there is a 2/3 probability the car was behind the remaining door.
The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
138I have pondered the Let’s Make a Deal problem for some 
time, and I came to the conclusion that it is 2/3 when I took 
a more dramatic variation of the problem. Suppose I had 100 doors and 1 of them had a car behind it. The rest had goats. If I chose one door, there would no doubt be a 1/100 chance that there was a car behind it. So the remaining doors combined would have a 99/100 chance of the car. Now no matter what was done to the other doors, there would still be a 1/100 chance of the car’s being behind the door that was chosen. So if the host knew that 98 of the doors did not have the car, and then eliminated those doors, the remaining door then must have had a 99/100 chance that there was a car behind it.
Suppose you had 100 doors. The chance of the car’s being be-
hind the contestant’s chosen door is 1/100, obviously a very slim chance that won’t change even when the host eliminates 98 doors. When the doors are eliminated, and all but two are left, the contestant still has chosen a door with a very, very slim chance the car is behind it, namely 1/100. Because the host knows where the car is (and where the goats are), and because 98 of the goats were eliminated, the remaining door has a (98
 
+
 
1)/100 chance there is a car behind it.
Note that initial reasoning may indicate that when there is only one door left, since 98 doors have been eliminated, the total number of possibilities for what’s behind the contestant’s 
ansWers
139door is two, a car or a goat. The favorable number of possi-
bilities is one, the car. So by strict definition of probability, the probability is 1/2 no matter what the host knows or did. But according to the previous paragraph, that is not the case.
I think probability has a somewhat ambiguous definition, es-
pecially if there is “conditional” probability, but it seems that if you tried the 100 doors out you would in fact find you’d get a 1/100 chance of getting the car.

add 2 to the second number, you get the third. If you add 3 to the third number, you get the fourth. If you add 4 to the fourth number, you get the fifth.)
So, the first number, call it N in the n
th part of the sequence is
1: N = 1 + [1 + 2 + 3 + … + (n – 1)] Now write this again backwards: 2: N = 1 + [(n – 1) + (n – 2) + (n – 3) + … + 1] + 1

143Adding (1) and (2), we get 2N = 1 + [(1 + n – 1) + (2 + n – 2)

This is just equal to 2N = 1 + 1 + [n taken (n – 1) times], or 
just 2 + n (n – 1).
So N = [2 + n(n – 1)]/2. So, if n = 100, thenN = [2 + 100(99)]/2 = [2 + 9,900]/2 = 4,951

Probability can be defined as the favorable number of possible 
outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Since one of the coins lands as a head, the total number of ways this is possible is the following:
five-cent head, ten-cent tailfive-cent head, ten-cent headfive-cent tail, ten-cent headThere couldn’t be a possibility of a ten-cent tail, ten-cent tail 
combination because we are told that one of the coins must be a head.
So there are three possibilities.Now, the favorable ways that the five-cent coin will land as 
a head are: 
five-cent head, ten-cent tailfive-cent head, ten-cent headThat is two ways out of three possible ways. Thus, the prob-
ability is 2/3.

70 percent and 80 percent.
Suppose we start with a price of $100 for each item. After 
the first discount, the first item will be $40. After the sec-ond discount, the item will be $24. This would represent an equivalent discount of 76 percent. Use the same process for the second and third item. For the second item, we would find that the price after the second discount is $25, which would represent an equivalent discount of 75 percent. For the third item, we would find the equivalent discount to be 79 percent. Thus, (b) is correct.

Again whichever of the three tips the scale is where the heavier ball is. So of the three balls (where one of them is heavier than the other two) weigh one against one. If they balance, the heavier ball is the remaining one. If they don’t balance, whichever ball tips the scale is the heavier one. 
Method 2: First weigh four balls with four balls. Suppose 
they balance. Then weigh the remaining four balls—two balls against two balls. Whichever two balls tip the scale downward include the heavier ball. So weigh one of those balls against the other. Whichever ball tips the scale down-ward is the heavier ball.
Suppose when we weigh the four balls against four balls, 
they don’t balance. The four balls that tip the scale down-ward have one of the balls that is heavier. So take these four balls and weigh two against two. One of the two balls will tip the scale downward. Whichever of the two balls tips the scale downward contains the heavy ball. Now weigh one

150of those balls with the other. The one that tips the scale 
downward is the heavy ball.
Method 3: First weigh three against three. If they balance, 
then weigh the other three against three. Certainly one side will be heavier so weigh the three balls where one is heavier, one against one. If they balance, it’s the remaining ball that is heavier. If they don’t balance, the ball that tips the scale downward is heavier.
If the original three against three don’t balance, take the three 
balls that tip the scale downward and weigh two of those balls, one on one side, the other on the other. If they balance, it’s the remaining ball. If they don’t balance, it’s the ball that tips the scale downward.

The key thing to realize is that the difference in ages between 
the man and his wife now is the same difference then or at any other time. That is,
(4) M – W = m – wSo substituting (2) and (3) into (4), we getM – W = W – M/2 or M – W = (2 W – M)/2, which gives us 
2M – 2W = 2W – M, so we get
(5) 3M = 4W or M = 4W/3We substitute (5) into (1) and we get:4W/3 + W = 91; 7W/3 = 91 and W = 273/7 = 39. From (1) 
we get M + 39 = 91, and so M = 52.

Translate: The number of apples that Bill bought = B, 
that Harry bought = H, and that Martin bought = M. “Bill 
bought four times as many apples as Harry” translates to B 
= 4H. Similarly B = 3M. “Bill, Harry, and Martin purchased 
a total of less than 190 apples” translates to B + H + M < 
190. You will find that manipulating these equations, we 
get B < 120. However, because H and M are integers, B = 
108 and not 119!
Here’s the complete solution:(1) B + H + M < 190(2) B = 4H(3) B = 3M
ansWers
153Substituting (3) into (1) we get 
(4) 3M + H + M < 190From (2) and (3), we get(5) 3M = 4H and so (6) H = 3M/4Substituting (6) into (4) we get(7) 3M + 3M/4 + M < 190This becomes (8) 19M/4 < 190 and thus(9) M/4 < 10, so M < 40.
  
So at this point you might think 
that M = 39. And from (3), B becomes 117. But from (6) we 
wouldn’t have H as a whole number! The greatest number 
less than 40 which the whole number M could be for (6) to 
be true is M = 36. Then H = 27, and from (3), B = 108.

numbers 1 through 9 be represented by a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, 
i. Then we have
(1) a + e + d + b = 17
(2) b + f + g + c = 17(3) c + h + i + a = 17(4) a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 45 (since all the numbers 
1 + 2 + 3…9 add up to 45)Adding (1), (2), (3) we get(5) 2a + 2b + 2c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 51.
ansWers
155Subtracting (4) from (5) we get a + b + c = 6. The only way 
this can be possible is if the numbers for a, b, and c are 1, 2, 3.
So start with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 at the vertex of the tri-
angle. For the left side, since the numbers must add up to 17, the other two numbers on the left side must add up to 14. The only possibilities are 6 and 8 or 5 and 9. If it is 5 and 9, then the remaining numbers are 4, 6, 7, 8. For the bottom side, two of these numbers (of 4, 6, 7, 8) must add up to 17 – 5 = 12. The only way is 4 and 8. So then we’d have 6 and 7 left. For the right side, 1
 + 3 + 6 + 7
 adds up to 16. Similarly you can see 
that for the left side 6 and 8 also works and we get the triangle on the right.

Let’s say there are a gallons of alcohol and w gallons of water

Now the amount of water poured into the alcohol is w. The

This becomes: (x/100) × 5 = 20.
Now here’s another strategy. Get rid of the fractions! Multiply 
both sides of the equation above by 100. You get:
(x)(5) 100  = 20 × 100
100
and you find(x)(5) = 20 × 100 = 2,000; Divide both sides of the equation 
by 5: x = 400.

Second weighing: two against twoThird weighing: one against oneTry to find a set of balls as “reference” balls, none of which is 
the heavy or light ball.
Note that even though the scale may tip downward in one di-
rection, the heavy ball may not be on the “downward” part of the scale; it may be that the lighter ball is on the upward side.
Let’s work through the solution:Identify balls by number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12(1, 2, 3) ? (4, 5, 6) means you weigh 1, 2, 3 vs. 4, 5, 6If the result of weighing is (1, 2, 3) < (4, 5, 6), it means first 
group (1, 2, 3) is lighter than the second, (4, 5, 6).
(1, 2, 3) > (4, 5, 6) means the first group (1, 2, 3) is heavier. 
(1, 2, 3) = (4, 5, 6) means both groups (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) weigh the same and so all the balls in that group are normal. N represents a normal ball.
Divide 12 balls into 3 groups: (1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8), (9, 10, 11, 12).First weighing: weigh (1, 2, 3, 4) ? (5, 6, 7, 8)CASE 1: Where (1, 2, 3, 4) = (5, 6, 7, 8)This means that the odd ball is in (9, 10, 11, 12) and that 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are normal (N)
ansWers
179Second weighing: weigh (N, 9) ? (10, 11)
If (N, 9) = (10, 11)This means the odd ball is 12.Third weighing: weigh (12) ? (N).If (12) > (N) then 12 is the heavy ball. If (12) < (N), then 12 
is the light ball.
If in the second weighing, (N, 9) > (10, 11), then either 9 is 
heavy or 10 or 11 is light.
Third weighing: weigh (10) ? (11).If (10) > (11), then 11 is light and 9 is normal. If (10) < (11), 
then 10 is light.
If in weighing (10) ? (11), (10) = (11), then 9 must be heavy.If in the second weighing, (N, 9) < (10, 11), you can similarly 
reason that 9 is light or 10 or 11 is heavy.
And then in the third weighing, weigh (10) ? (11).If (10) > (11), then 10 is heavy. If (10) < (11), then 11 is 
heavy. If (10) = (11), then 9 is light.
CASE 2: Where in the first weighing, (1, 2, 3, 4) > (5, 6, 7, 8) .Then you know that 9, 10, 11, 12 are normal (N), and one of 
the balls 1, 2, 3, 4 is heavy or one of the balls 5, 6, 7, 8 is light.
Second weighing: weigh (N, 1, 2) ? (3, 4, 5)If (N, 1, 2) = (3, 4, 5) then the odd ball is in (6, 7, 8) and is 
The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
180lighter, so weigh (6) ? (7) and pick the lightest. If (6) = (7) then 
8 is light.
If (N, 1, 2) > (3, 4, 5), (3, 4) are normal, so odd is in (1, 2, 5).Third weighing: weigh (1) ? (2).If (1) > (2) then 1 is heavy; if (1) < (2), then 2 is heavy; if 
(1) = (2), then 5 is light.
Second weighing: For the case where (N, 1, 2) < (3, 4, 5), 
the odd ball is in (3, 4) and is heavy, since 5 can’t be heavy, and (1, 2), which were in the heavy group originally, are not the heavy ones, now.
Third weighing: So weigh (3) ? (4). If (3) > (4), 3 is heavy. If 
(3) < (4), then 4 is heavy.
CASE 3: Where in the first weighing, (1, 2, 3, 4) < (5, 6, 7, 8).Second weighing: weigh (N, 1, 2) ? (3, 4, 5). If (N, 1, 2) = 
(3, 4, 5), odd ball is in (6, 7, 8) and is heavier, so weigh (6) ? (7) (third weighing) and pick the heaviest. If (6) = (7), then 8 is heavy.
If (N, 1, 2) > (3, 4, 5), the odd ball is in (3, 4) and is light, 
since according to the first weighing, (5) can’t be light and (1, 2) cannot be heavy.
Third weighing: So weigh (3) ? (4). If (3) > (4), then 4 is 
light. If (3) < (4), then 3 is light.
If in the second weighing, (N, 1, 2) < (3, 4, 5), then either 
ansWers
181(1,2) is light or 5 is heavy because of the first weighing.
Third weighing: So weigh (1) ? (2). If (1) > (2), then 2 is light. 
If (1) < (2), then 1 is light. If (1) = (2), then 5 is heavy.

first and second students cannot figure out the color of their hats.
The color of the third student’s hat is red. He reasons, “If I 
can prove it’s impossible that I have a white hat, then I must have a red hat.” There are only three scenarios in which the last student could have a white hat:
(1) 
 if 
the first student has a red hat and the second student 
has a white hat,
(2) 
 if 
the first student has a white hat and the second student 
has a red hat, and
(3) if both the first and second students have red hats.Scenario (1) is ruled out because the first student would 
have known his hat was red if the other two students had white hats, since there were only two white hats in the original bag. Scenario (2) is ruled out because the second student would have made the same deduction. Scenario (3) 
The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
182is ruled out because the second student would have known 
she was wearing a red hat if the third student was wearing a white hat, because otherwise the first student would have seen that they were both wearing white hats. But because the second student did not know or figure out that she was wearing a red hat, the third student could not be wearing a white hat. Thus the only combinations are (where A, B, C denote first, second, third student respectively):
A—White; B—White; C—RedA— White; B—Red; C—RedA—Red; B—White; C—RedA—Red; B—Red; C—RedThus, (b) is correct.

Solution
1.	Draw EF parallel to BC. Then angle DFE = 80º because of equal 
corresponding angles of parallel lines.
2.	Drop a perpendicular line to BC from A, hitting BC at G. Because 
of congruent triangles ABG and AGC, angle BAG = angle CAG = 
10º.
3.	Now draw line FC, calling H the point where line FC intersects line 
BE. Line AG passes through point H, because of symmetry.
4.	Angle BHC = 60º since the other angles of the triangle BHC are 
both 60º.
5.	BE = FC (because of corresponding sides of congruent triangles 
FBC and EBC). BH = HC (call BH b) because triangle BHC is 
isosceles. So by subtraction, FH = HE.
The World’s 200 hardes T Brain Teasers
1866.	Since angle FHE = 60º (vertical angle to BHC), and because 
FH =
  H
E from 5, angle FHE = angle HEF = 60º, so triangle 
FHE is equilateral. Thus, FE = FH = HE. Call each of those sides 
a.
7.	Now AF = AE (because AB = AC and FB = EC, by subtraction 
AF = AE).
8.	Because triangle AEB is isosceles, AE = BE = b + a. Thus, 
AF = BE = b + a (since AF = AE from 7).
9.	BE = FC (congruent triangles BEC and BFC), so AF = FC, since 
AF = BE from 8.
10.	 Now watch this: Triangle AFH is congruent to triangle CFD because AF = FC; angle AFH = 140º = angle CFD;  angle

CF = 1
0º = a
ngle F
AH. Thus, corresponding sides of 
the congruent triangles AFH and triangle CFD are equal, so  FH = FD. But FH = FE from 6, so FE = FD.
11.	 Since FE = FD, angle FDE = angle FED and since angle  D FE = 8 0º 
from (1), angle FDE = 50º = angle FED.
12.	 But angle FDC = 30º, so by subtraction, angle EDC = 20º!

Gary R. Gruber, PhD, is recognized nationally as the leading expert on 
standardized tests and originator and developer of the critical-thinking skills necessary for use on standardized tests. It is said that no one in the nation is better at assessing the thinking patterns of how a person answers questions and providing the mechanism to improve the faulty thinking approaches. Dr. Gruber’s SAT score improvements with stu-dents have been documented to be the highest in the nation.
Dr. Gruber’s unique methods have been used by the Public 
Broadcasting Service (PBS), Sylvan Learning Centers, and Grolier’s 
Encyclopedia, and they are being used by school districts throughout the country, in homes and workplaces across the nation, and by a host of other entities. Most recently he has trained the University of California’s teachers to create programs for specific critical-thinking and problem-solving skills for their minority programs.

critical-thinking methods, with over seven million copies sold. He has also authored over one thousand articles in both scholarly jour-nals as well as in newspapers syndicated nationally, has appeared on numerous television and radio shows, and has been interviewed in hundreds of publications. He has developed major programs for school districts and for city and state educational agencies for improving and restructuring curriculum, increasing learning abil-ity and test scores, increasing motivation, developing a passion for learning and problem solving, and decreasing student dropout rates. His results have been lauded throughout the country by people from all walks of life.
His mission is to get the nation impassioned with learning and 
problem solving so that people don’t merely try to get a quick an-swer, but actually enjoy and look forward to solving the problem and learning. With this approach, Dr. Gruber believes that we’d have a nation of critical thinkers who would find problem solving enjoyable. Because of Dr. Gruber’s tenacity, passion, and creativity for solving problems, and having used the strategies he has developed and honed for years, the Washington Post has called him “the super genius.”
